# RFM Marketing Analysis with Analytical SQL

Marketing Analysis on an online store using RFM Analytical Model with Analytical SQL

### What's RFM Analysis?
***RFM*** Stands for ***Recency***, ***Frequency*** and ***Monetary*** which is a form of analysis often used in Marketing which segments customers based on those 3 factors.

### Questions answered in this project:

- What's the total number of customers, orders and the avg total paid price)
- Total number of orders made based on time intervals
- Total quantities sold based on time intervals
- Total price paid per time interval
- Total price paid per time interval per customer
- Segmenting customers based on their ***recent paid order***, ***order frequency*** and ***how much s/he pays***


------------------------------------------------------

```sql
-- Finding # of customers, # of orders and the avg paid price per country 
SELECT DISTINCT country,
                COUNT(DISTINCT invoice) OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS Number_Of_Orders,
                COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS Number_Of_Customers,
                ROUND(AVG(price*quantity) OVER(PARTITION BY country),2) AS Avg_Payment
FROM tableretail
ORDER BY Number_Of_Orders DESC, Number_Of_Customers DESC;
```
***Output:***

|  COUNTRY    |  NUMBER_OF_ORDERS  |   NUMBER_OF_CUSTOMERS    |   AVG_PAYMENT    |
|     :---:    |     :---:      |     :---:      |     :---:      |

### Quick Insights:
- There's a total order of 717 and 110 customers, They are all based in the UK.
- The avg payment paid per order is 19.89 Pounds
- The majority of orders are made during morning to noon with an interval of approximately 09:00 AM to 4:30 PM.
- The highest amount paid also fits the same interval with an exception of a single occurrence **8/4/2011 18:06**
- Based on the quantities ordered and total paid price, Customers tend to order frequently multiple goods ***which we will try to validate throught the next step***



## Customer Segmentation using RFM

### Step #1
***Extracting the highest date of each employee along with their order frequency and total price paid***
```sql
-- Step #1 - Extracting the highest date of each employee along with their order frequency and total price paid
SELECT customer_id,
       MAX(TO_DATE(invoicedate, 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI')) AS Last_Date,
       COUNT(invoice) AS Order_Count,
       SUM(price*quantity) AS Total_Price
FROM tableretail
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

### Step #2
***Figuring out the recency of ordering per customer***
```sql
-- Step #2 figuring out the recency of ordering per customer
SELECT customer_id,
            Last_Date,
            ROUND((ROUND(MONTHS_BETWEEN(TO_DATE('12/9/2011 12:20','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI'),Last_Date),2)/30)*1000,0) Recency,
            Order_Count,
            Total_Price
FROM (SELECT customer_id,
             MAX(TO_DATE(invoicedate, 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI')) AS Last_Date,
             COUNT(invoice) AS Order_Count,
             SUM(price*quantity) AS Total_Price
     FROM tableretail
     GROUP BY customer_id
     ORDER BY customer_id) inner_table
ORDER BY Recency;
```

### Step #3
***Using NTILE to segment the 2 factors (Recency and Monetary) *removed frequency since it indicates the volume as Monetary does* to segment customers in the next step***
```sql
-- Step #3 using NTILE to segment the 2 factors (Recency and Monetary) *removed frequency since it indicates the volume as Monetary does* to segment customers in the next step
SELECT customer_id,
       NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY Recency) AS Recency,
       NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY Total_Price) AS Monetary
FROM( SELECT customer_id,
             Last_Date,
             ROUND((ROUND(MONTHS_BETWEEN(TO_DATE('12/9/2011 12:20','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI'),Last_Date),2)/30)*1000,0) Recency,
             Order_Count,
             Total_Price
       FROM (SELECT customer_id,
                    MAX(TO_DATE(invoicedate, 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI')) AS Last_Date,
                    COUNT(invoice) AS Order_Count,
                    SUM(price*quantity) AS Total_Price
             FROM tableretail
             GROUP BY customer_id
             ORDER BY customer_id) inner_table) outer_table;
```

### Step #4
***Segmenting the customers based on (Recency and Monetary) Scores***
```sql
-- Step #4 Segmenting the customers based on (Recency and Monetary) Scores
WITH customer_segment AS
(
SELECT customer_id,
            NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY Recency) AS Recency,
            NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY Total_Price) AS Monetary
FROM( SELECT customer_id,
            Last_Date,
            ROUND((ROUND(MONTHS_BETWEEN(TO_DATE('12/9/2011 12:20','MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI'),Last_Date),2)/30)*1000,0) Recency,
            Order_Count,
            Total_Price
            FROM (SELECT customer_id,
                                    MAX(TO_DATE(invoicedate, 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI')) AS Last_Date,
                                    COUNT(invoice) AS Order_Count,
                                    SUM(price*quantity) AS Total_Price
                        FROM tableretail
                        GROUP BY customer_id
                        ORDER BY customer_id) inner_table) outer_table

### Conclusion:
- Based on our customer segmentation analysis, we have identified five distinct customer groups, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. With this information, we can recommend to the marketing team to focus on developing a customized plan to target customers who have a score of 3 to 5. These customers are highly active and considered loyal, and nurturing their loyalty through targeted marketing efforts can help retain them.
- On the other hand, customers with a score of 1 and 2 are most likely churned, and any marketing plan may not be as effective in re-engaging them. By focusing on the right customer groups, the marketing team can optimize their efforts and achieve better results.
